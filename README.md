# Requirements
* [X-Plane 12](https://www.x-plane.com/) as I'm not testing this in X-Plane 11
* [Flight Factor 777-200 for X-Plane 12](https://store.x-plane.org/777-200ER-v2-Ultimate_p_1883.html)
* [FlyWithLua 2.8 for X-Plane 12](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/82888-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-plus-edition-for-x-plane-12-win-lin-mac/)
* [Yawman Arrow Controller](https://yawmanflight.com/)

# Installation
Note that the current script does not modify your axes. You'll need to set up your Yawman Arrow's axes as you like.

Save _FF B772 Yawman Multipress.lua_ to /X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts

Assignments closely matches Yawman's PMDG 777 mappings. See their [discord](https://discord.gg/dcpTc5KP).

Also see [the script for the Felis 747-200](https://github.com/rpmik/Lua-Controller-Mapping-Felis-B742).

# Assignments are In Work!
